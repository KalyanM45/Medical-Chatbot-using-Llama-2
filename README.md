## About The Project

This project leverages natural language processing and information retrieval techniques to create an interactive system for answering user queries based on a collection of PDF documents. The process begins with loading and segmenting PDFs into smaller text chunks. These chunks are then embedded using a pre-trained Hugging Face model. The embeddings are indexed using Pinecone, a vector search engine, facilitating efficient similarity searches. User queries are processed using a retrieval question-answering (QA) system, which combines the Pinecone index, a language model loaded from a file, and a defined prompt template. The project aims to provide concise and accurate responses to user queries, fostering a seamless interaction between the user and the information stored in the PDF documents.

## Built With

- Python
- LangChain
- Flask
- Meta Llama2
- Pinecone

## Getting Started

This will help you understand how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Installation Steps

### Option 1: Installation from GitHub

Follow these steps to install and set up the project directly from the GitHub repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to install the project.
   - Run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/KalyanMurapaka45/Medical-Chatbot-using-Llama-2.git
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)
   - It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Run the following command:
     ```
     conda create -p <Environment_Name> python==<python version> -y
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment** (Optional)
   - Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:
       ```
       conda activate <Environment_Name>/
       ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd [project_directory]
     ```
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Project**
   - Start the project by running the appropriate command.
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

6. **Access the Project**
   - Open a web browser or the appropriate client to access the project.


## API Key Setup


### Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Pinecone credentials as follows:

```ini
PINECONE_API_KEY = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
PINECONE_API_ENV = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```


### Download the quantize model from the link provided in model folder & keep the model in the model directory:

```ini

Model: llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin

URL: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/tree/main
```
